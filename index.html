            <p>
                Calamba is perhaps best known as the birthplace of Dr. Jose Rizal, the Philippine national hero. Jose Protacio Rizal Mercado y Alonzo Realonda was born on June 19, 1861, in the ancestral house now known as the Rizal Shrine. The historical significance of Calamba is deeply intertwined with the life and legacy of Rizal, whose writings and ideals played a crucial role in the quest for Philippine independence.

                    <h1>Keso Puti</h1>
                    <p>Kesong puti is a Filipino soft, unaged, white cheese made from unskimmed carabao milk and salt curdled with vinegar, citrus juices, or sometimes rennet. It can also be made with goat or cow milk. It has a mild salty and tart flavor. When an acidifying agent is used, it resembles queso blanco or paneer.
